# 📈 Predicting Ad Campaign Conversion in Digital Marketing
🔍 Unlock the Power of Data to Optimize Your Marketing Campaigns!

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on predicting ad campaign conversion rates using advanced machine learning techniques. By analyzing digital marketing data, we identify key factors that drive successful conversions and help marketers make data-driven decisions.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts customer conversion based on various demographic, behavioral, and campaign-related features. This system enables businesses to optimize marketing strategies by targeting potential customers more effectively.

- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Age**: Age of the customer.
- **Gender**: Gender of the customer.
- **Income**: Annual income of the customer.
- **CampaignChannel**: The marketing channel used to reach the customer.
- **CampaignType**: Type of marketing campaign.
- **AdSpend**: Amount spent on advertisements.
- **ClickThroughRate**: Percentage of users who clicked on an ad.
- **ConversionRate**: Percentage of users who converted after interacting with an ad.
- **WebsiteVisits**: Number of visits to the website.
- **PagesPerVisit**: Average number of pages viewed per visit.
- **TimeOnSite**: Time spent on the website.
- **SocialShares**: Number of times content was shared on social media.
- **EmailOpens**: Number of marketing emails opened.
- **EmailClicks**: Number of links clicked in marketing emails.
- **PreviousPurchases**: Number of past purchases made by the customer.
- **LoyaltyPoints**: Reward points accumulated by the customer.
- **AdvertisingPlatform**: Platform used for advertising (Google, Facebook, etc.).
- **AdvertisingTool**: Specific tool used for running ads.
- **Conversion** (Target Variable): Whether the customer converted (1) or not (0).

## Methodology
1. **Data Exploration**: Initial analysis and visualization of dataset features.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and normalizing numerical features.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features, transformations, and encoding categorical variables.
4. **Model Selection**: Evaluating multiple machine learning models, including Stacking Classifier, XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model parameters for better performance.
6. **Evaluation Metrics**: Using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for model assessment.
7. **Deployment**: Developing a Flask web application with CSV upload & manual input options for real-time predictions.
8. **Visualization & Reports**: Generating interactive dashboards for data insights and predictions.
